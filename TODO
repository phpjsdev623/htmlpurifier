TODO List

Ongoing
 - Lots of profiling, make it faster!
 - Plugins for major CMSes (very tricky issue)

1.0 release
 - Limited list-style shorthand CSS support
 - Lossy alternate character encoding support (characters not in the encoding
   will get silently dropped).
 - Revise (HTML|CSS)Definition and Config relationship (groundwork for 2.0)

1.1 release
 - Directive documentation generation
 - Rewrite table's child definition to be faster, smart, and regexp free
 - Allow HTML 4.01 output (cosmetic changes to the generator)

1.2 release
 - Additional support for poorly written HTML
    - Implement all non-essential attribute transforms
    - Microsoft Word HTML cleaning (i.e. MsoNormal)

1.3 release
 - Make URI validation routines tighter (especially mailto)
 - More extensive URI filtering schemes
 - Allow for background-image and list-style-image (see above)
 - Distinguish between different types of URIs, for instance, a mailto URI
   in IMG SRC is nonsensical

2.0 release
 - Add various "levels" of cleaning
    - Related: Allow strict (X)HTML

3.0 release
 - Extended HTML capabilities based on namespacing and tag transforms
    - Hooks for adding custom processors to custom namespaced tags and
      attributes, offer default implementation
    - Auto-paragraphing (be sure to leverage fact that we know when things
      shouldn't be paragraphed, such as lists and tables).
    - Lots of documentation and samples

Unknown release (on a scratch-an-itch basis)
 - Silently drop content inbetween SCRIPT tags (can be generalized to allow
   specification of elements that, when detected as foreign, trigger removal
   of children, although unbalanced tags could wreck havoc (or at least delete
   the rest of the document)).
 - Fixes for Firefox's inability to handle COL alignment props (Bug 915)
 - Automatically add non-breaking spaces to empty table cells when
   empty-cells:show is applied to have compatibility with Internet Explorer
 - Pretty-printing HTML (adds dependency of Generator to HTMLDefinition)
 - Non-lossy dumb alternate character encoding transformations, achieved by
   numerically encoding all non-ASCII characters

Wontfix
 - Non-lossy smart alternate character encoding transformations
