TODO List

Ongoing
 - Lots of profiling, make it faster!
 - Plugins for major CMSes (very tricky issue)

1.2 release
 - Make URI validation routines tighter (especially mailto)
 - More extensive URI filtering schemes
 - Allow for background-image and list-style-image (see above)
 - Distinguish between different types of URIs, for instance, a mailto URI
   in IMG SRC is nonsensical
 - Error logging for filtering/cleanup procedures

1.3 release
 - Add various "levels" of cleaning
    - Related: Allow strict (X)HTML

1.4 release
 - Additional support for poorly written HTML
    - Implement all non-essential attribute transforms
    - Microsoft Word HTML cleaning (i.e. MsoNormal)

2.0 release
 - Formatters for plaintext
    - Auto-paragraphing (be sure to leverage fact that we know when things
      shouldn't be paragraphed, such as lists and tables).
    - Linkify URLs
    - Smileys

3.0 release
 - Extended HTML capabilities based on namespacing and tag transforms
    - Hooks for adding custom processors to custom namespaced tags and
      attributes, offer default implementation
    - Lots of documentation and samples

Unknown release (on a scratch-an-itch basis)
 - Silently drop content inbetween SCRIPT tags (can be generalized to allow
   specification of elements that, when detected as foreign, trigger removal
   of children, although unbalanced tags could wreck havoc (or at least delete
   the rest of the document)).
 - Fixes for Firefox's inability to handle COL alignment props (Bug 915)
 - Automatically add non-breaking spaces to empty table cells when
   empty-cells:show is applied to have compatibility with Internet Explorer
 - Non-lossy dumb alternate character encoding transformations, achieved by
   numerically encoding all non-ASCII characters
 - Semi-lossy dumb alternate character encoding transformations, achieved by
   encoding all characters that have string entity equivalents
 - Convert RTL/LTR override characters to <bdo> tags, or vice versa on demand.
   Also, enable disabling of directionality

Requested
 - Native content compression, whitespace stripping (don't rely on Tidy, make
   sure we don't remove from pre tags)
 - Win32 Phalanger C# binaries

Wontfix
 - Non-lossy smart alternate character encoding transformations
 - Pretty-printing HTML, users can use Tidy on the output on entire page
