Lexer

The lexer parses a string of SGML-style markup and converts them into
corresponding tokens. It doesn't check for correctness, although it's
internal mechanism may make this automatic (such as the case of DOMLex).

We have several implementations of the Lexer:

DirectLex - our in-house implementation
    DirectLex has absolutely no dependencies, making it a reasonably good
    default for PHP4.  Written with efficiency in mind, it is generally
    faster than the PEAR parser, although the two are very close and usually
    overlap a bit.  It will support UTF-8 completely eventually.

PEARSax3 - uses the PEAR package XML_HTMLSax3 to parse
    PEAR, not suprisingly, also has a SAX parser for HTML.  I don't know
    very much about implementation, but it's fairly well written.  You need
    to have PEAR added to your path to use it though.  Not sure whether or
    not it's UTF-8 aware.

DOMLex - uses the PHP5 core extension DOM to parse
    In PHP 5, the DOM XML extension was revamped into DOM and added to the core.
    It gives us a forgiving HTML parser, which we use to transform the HTML
    into a DOM, and then into the tokens.  It is extremely fast, and is the
    default choice for PHP 5.  However, entity resolution may be troublesome,
    though it's UTF-8 is excellent.
