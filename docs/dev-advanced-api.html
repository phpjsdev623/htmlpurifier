<p>HTML Purifier currently natively supports only a subset of HTML's
allowed elements, attributes, and behavior. This is by design,
but as the user is always right, they'll need some method to overload
these behaviors.</p>

<p>Our goals are to let the user:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Select</dt>
    <dd><ul>
        <li>Doctype</li>
        <li>Mode: Lenient / Correctional</li>
        <li>Elements / Attributes / Modules</li>
        <li>Filterset</li>
    </ul></dd>
    <dt>Customize</dt>
    <dd><ul>
        <li>Attributes</li>
        <li>Elements</li>
    </ul></dd>
    <dt>Internals</dt>
    <dd><ul>
        <li>Modules / Elements / Attributes / Attribute Types</li>
        <li>Filtersets</li>
        <li>Doctype</li>
    </ul></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Select</h2>

<p>For basic use, the user will have to specify some basic parameters. This
is not strictly necessary, as HTML Purifier's default setting will always
output safe code, but is required for standards-compliant output.</p>

<h3>Selecting a Doctype</h3>

<p>The first thing to select is the <strong>doctype</strong>. This
is essential for standards-compliant output.</p>

<p class="technical">This identifier is based
on the name the W3C has given to the document type and <em>not</em>
the DTD identifier.</p>

<p>This parameter is set via the configuration object:</p>

<pre>$config->set('HTML', 'Doctype', 'XHTML 1.0 Transitional');</pre>

<p>Due to historical reasons, the default doctype is XHTML 1.0
Transitional, however, we really shouldn't be guessing what the user's
doctype is. Fortunantely, people who can't be bothered to set this won't
be bothered when their pages stop validating.</p>

<h3>Selecting Mode</h3>

<p>Within doctypes, there are various <strong>modes</strong> of operation.
These indicate variant behaviors that, while not strictly changing the
allowed set of elements and attributes, definitely affect the output.
Currently, we have two modes, which may be used together:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Lenient</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Deprecated elements and attributes will be transformed into
        standards-compliant alternatives when explicitly disallowed.</p>
        <p>For example, in the XHTML 1.0 Strict doctype, a <code>center</code>
        element would be turned into a <code>div</code> with the CSS property
        <code>text-align:center;</code>, but in XHTML 1.0 Transitional
        the element would be preserved.</p>
        <p>This mode is on by default.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Correctional[items to correct]</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Deprecated elements and attributes will be transformed into
        standards-compliant alternatives whenever possible.
        It may have various levels of operation.</p>
        <p>Referring back to the previous example, the <code>center</code> element would
        be transformed in both cases. However, elements without a
        reasonable standards-compliant alternative will be preserved
        in their form.</p>
        <p>A user may want to correct certain deprecated attributes, but
        not others. For example, the <code>bgcolor</code> attribute may be
        acceptable, but the <code>center</code> element not; also, possibly,
        an HTML Purifier transformation may be buggy, so the user wants
        to forgo it. Thus, correctional accepts an array defining which
        elements and attributes to cleanup, or no parameter at all, which
        means everything gets corrected. This also means that each
        correction needs to be given a unique ID that can be referenced
        in this manner. (We may also allow globbing, like *.name or a.*
        for mass-enabling correction, and subtractive mode, where things
        specified stop correction.) This array gets passed into the
        constructor of the mode's module.</p>
        <p>This mode is on by default.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>A possible call to select modes would be:</p>

<pre>$config->set('HTML', 'Mode', array('correctional', 'lenient'));</pre>

<p>If modes have extra parameters, a hash is necessary:</p>

<pre>$config->set('HTML', 'Mode', array(
    'correctional' => 'center,a.name',
    'lenient' => true // this one's just boolean
));</pre>

<p>Modes may be specified along with the doctype declaration (we may want
to get a better set of separator characters):</p>

<pre>$config->setDoctype('XHTML Transitional 1.0', '+correctional[center,a.name] -lenient');</pre>

<p>
With regards to the various levels of operation conjectured in the
Correctional mode, this is prompted by the fact that a user may want to
correct certain problems but not others, for example, fix the <code>center</code>
element but not the <code>u</code> element, both of which are deprecated.
Having an integer <q>level</q> will not work very well for such fine
grained tweaking, but an array of specific settings might.</p>

<h3>Selecting Elements / Attributes / Modules</h3>

<p></p>

<p>If this cookie cutter approach doesn't appeal to a user, they may
decide to roll their own filterset by selecting modules, elements and
attributes to allow.</p>

<p class="technical">This would make use of the same facilities
as a filterset author would use, except that it would go under an
<q>anonymous</q> filterset that would be auto-selected if any of the
relevant module/elements/attribute selection configuration directives were
non-null.</p>

<p>In practice, this is the most commonly demanded feature. Most users are
perfectly happy defining a filterset that looks like:</p>

<pre>$config->setAllowedHTML('a[href,title];em;p;blockquote');</pre>

<p class="technical">The directive %HTML.Allowed is a convenience function
that may be fully expressed with the legacy interface, and thus is
given its own setter.</p>

<p>We currently support a separated interface, which also must be preserved:</p>

<pre>$config->set('HTML', 'AllowedElements', 'a,em,p,blockquote');
$config->set('HTML', 'AllowedAttributes', 'a.href,a.title');</pre>

<p>A user may also choose to allow modules:</p>

<pre>$config->set('HTML', 'AllowedModules', 'Hypertext,Text,Lists'); // or
$config->setAllowedHTML('Hypertext,Text,Lists');</pre>

<p>But it is not expected that this feature will be widely used.</p>

<p class="fixme">The granularity of these modules is too coarse for
the average user (for example, the core module loads everything from
the essential <code>p</code> element to the not-so-safe <code>h1</code>
element). How do we make this still a viable solution? Possible answers
may be sub-modules or module parameters. This may not even be a problem,
considering that most people won't be selecting modules.</p>

<p class="technical">Modules are distinguished from regular elements by the
case of their first letter. While XML distinguishes between and allows
lower and uppercase letters in element names, most well-known XML
languages use only lower-case
element names for sake of consistency.</p>

<p class="technical">Considering that, internally speaking, as mandated by
the XHTML 1.1 Modularization specification, we have organized our
elements around modules, considerable gymnastics will be needed to
get this sort of functionality working.</p>

<h3>Unified selector</h3>

<p>Because selecting each and every one of these configuration options
is a chore, we may wish to offer a specialized configuration method
for selecting a filterset. Possibility:</p>

<pre>function selectFilter($doctype, $filterset, $mode)</pre>

<p>...which is simply a light wrapper over the individual configuration
calls. A custom config file format or text format could also be adopted.</p>

<h2>Customize</h2>

<p>By reviewing topic posts in the support forum, we determined that
there were two primarily demanded customization features people wanted:
to add an attribute to an existing element, and to add an element.
Thus, we'll want to create convenience functions for these common
use-cases.</p>

<p>Note that the functions described here are only available if
a raw copy of <code>HTMLPurifier_HTMLDefinition</code> was retrieved.
<code>addAttribute</code> may work on a processed copy, but for
consistency's sake we will mandate this for everything.</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>

<p>An attribute is bound to an element by a name and has a specific
<code>AttrDef</code> that validates it. Thus, the interface should
be:</p>

<pre>function addAttribute($element, $attribute, $attribute_def);</pre>

<p>With a use-case that looks like:</p>

<pre>$def->addAttribute('a', 'rel', new HTMLPurifier_AttrDef_Enum(array('nofollow')));</pre>

<p>The <code>$attribute_def</code> value can be a little flexible,
to make things simpler. We'll let it also be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Class name: We'll instantiate it for you</li>
    <li>Function name: We'll create an <code>HTMLPurifier_AttrDef_Anonymous</code>
        class with that function registered as a callback.</li>
    <li>String attribute type: We'll use <code>HTMLPurifier_AttrTypes</code>
        </li>
    <li>String starting with <code>enum(</code>: We'll explode it and stuff it in an
        <code>HTMLPurifier_AttrDef_Enum</code> for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Making the previous example written as:</p>

<pre>$def->addAttribute('a', 'rel', 'enum(nofollow)');</pre>

<h3>Elements</h3>

<p>An element requires certain information as specified by
<code>HTMLPurifier_ElementDef</code>. However, not all of it is necessary,
the usual things required are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Attributes</li>
    <li>Content model/type</li>
    <li>Registration in a content set</li>
</ul>

<p>This suggests an API like this:</p>

<pre>function addElement($element, $type, $content_model, $attributes = array());</pre>

<p>Each parameter explained in depth:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><code>$element</code></dt>
    <dd>Element name, ex. 'label'</dd>
    <dt><code>$type</code></dt>
    <dd>Content set to register in, ex. 'Inline' or 'Flow'</dd>
    <dt><code>$content_model</code></dt>
    <dd>Description of allowed children. This is a merged form of
        <code>HTMLPurifier_ElementDef</code>'s member variables
        <code>$content_model</code> and <code>$content_model_type</code>,
        where the form is <q>Type: Model</q>, ex. 'Optional: Inline'.</dd>
    <dt><code>$attributes</code></dt>
    <dd>Array of attribute names to attribute definitions, much like
        the above-described attribute customization.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A possible usage:</p>

<pre>$def->addElement('font', 'Inline', 'Optional: Inline',
    array(0 => array('Common'), 'color' => 'Color'));</pre>

<p>We may want to Common attribute collection inclusion to be added
by default.</p>
