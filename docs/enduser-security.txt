Security

Like anything that claims to afford security, HTML_Purifier can be circumvented
through negligence of people. This class will do its job: no more, no less,
and it's up to you to provide it the proper information and proper context
to be effective. Things to remember:

1. Character Encoding: see enduser-utf8.html for more info.

2. Doctype: document pending feature completion
Not strictly necessary, actually. More in-depth discussion once we figure
out how to get strict loose mode working.

3. IDs: see enduser-id.html for more info

4. Links: document pending feature completion
Rudimentary blacklisting, we should also allow only relative URIs. We
need a doc to explain the stuff.

5. CSS: document pending
Explain which CSS styles we blocked and why.
