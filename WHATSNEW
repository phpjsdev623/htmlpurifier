Version 2.1.2 is a mix of experimental features and stability updates.
Among new features: an Object module for trusted users, support for the
CSS property 'border-spacing', and HTML 5 style parsing using PH5P.
Bug fixes ihave resolved a few obscure issues including border-collapse:seperate,
a DirectLex parsing error, broken HTML in printDefinition.php, and problems
with the experimental standalone distribution. Also, there were large
amounts of behind-the-scenes refactoring and the removal of URIScheme
inclusion reflection.
