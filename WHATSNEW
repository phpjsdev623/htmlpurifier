The 2.0.1 release introduces a number of stability and usability fixes,
as well as a number of (disabled by default) experimental features.  The
security-minded should note that a reflected XSS vulnerability was patched
in smoketests/configForm.php; if you cannot upgrade immediately, please
delete that file (if that directory is not publically accessible, there
is no security risk).  The maintenance changes include more helpful file
permissions errors, internal newline normalization, reordered includes
to prevent a missing class definition in some setups, and better cache
revision and id handling.  The two experimental features are auto-formatting
(auto-paragraphing and linkification) and error collection, these can
be enabled with %AutoFormat.AutoParagraph, %AutoFormat.Linkify and
%Core.CollectErrors respectively.
